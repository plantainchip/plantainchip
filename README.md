I'm a Computer Science student, almost at the finish line to get my degree 🌞
I love making digital art, specifically pixel art, and watercolor paintings 🌝
I'm also something of a game developer myself. After I get my degree, I want to build and publish my first real game.
In the meantime, check out some of my smaller web games 

I’m currently learning ...
  * Javascript and KAPLAY

Recently worked on  ...
  * B1tJam2 game jam entry called 'In the Calyx'
